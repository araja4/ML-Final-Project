    "In this project, we have a data set of jeopardy questions and we want to train a model to classify these questions by their categories. We will first prepare and manipulate the data and discuss the process of vectorizing the data. Then, we will train a basic Multinomial Naive Bayes model using Sklearn and then train an SVM model with Grid Search to find the optimal parameters. Finally, we will compare the performance of these models and try to change the categories we are classifying to improve our models."

    "\n",
    "##### Overall Accuracy:\n",
    "We got about 72% accuracy with just a simple Naive Bayes model. For a start, this is not bad, but only 72% is not a good enough accuracy. This is due to the fact that some of the categories have overlapping content with the others. In fact, Potpourri, by definition, is a mixture of things, and therefore, the questions in this category could have easily been anything, including being a history question or a literature question or a science question. Thus, a question about science could have been in either Potpourri or Science and both answers would have been correct. The fact that some categories are subsets of others and that there is no clear line to classify these categories can lead to a low accuracy value. Below, as we improve our project, we will train with questions and categories that have less overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Normalizing vs Not Normalizing:\n",
    "We actually got a lower accuracy with normalizing for length. This is because these questions are Jeopardy questions, and thus, they have relatively the same length, leading to little to no difference between normalizing and not. However, since the values are close enough, we will just keep the normalizing step in case we ever need to extend this to apply to a different data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try a different model\n",
    "Now let's see if we can do better with a different text classifying algorithm. Here we will try the linear support vector machine algorithm, which is a popular text classification algorithm. The biggest difference between SVM and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) is that MNB treats the features as independent features with no dependencies while SVM looks for interaction among features. Thus, SVM is theoretically better for when there are dependencies among the features (where some words usually appear together in a common phrase) since SVM can take into account these dependencies whereas MNB cannot. Given our data set, we want to see if SVM would be better than a MNB since our data contains shorter questions, and the words in the questions may or may not have any relationship. This is motivated by a paper that suggests MNB is better than SVM for shorter snippets (https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf) and since we have really short questions that resemble snippets a little bit, we want to test this out."

    "\n",
    "We obtained an accuracy of about 84% when running on the 5 hand-selected categories. Again, we picked these categories because we think that they are different enough for a decent accuracy score, and we got a pretty decent score as predicted. We only did slightly worse than when we ran with only 3 categories, which makes sense since we are adding more categories to classify. This shows that we need to formulate our problem carefully to ensure that there is little overlapping among the target groups and that no group is a subgroup of another since that will definitely confuse the MNB model. \n",

There are so many models out there to try and we need to analyze our data set more rigoriously to determine what model would fit the data the best.\n",
